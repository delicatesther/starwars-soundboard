This is the most definitive collection of Star
Wars sound effects you will ever find, and it
is still growing.

This collection was made possible through years
of research, collecting and a #$&@-ton of video
games. The contributors dedicated themselves to
collecting only the highest-quality sounds
available, and only sounds that have been
featured in the Star Wars films. This pack is
not final; ergo, it is constantly being updated
with new content on a not-so-regular basis. Fun
part is, YOU can help to contribute to this
wonderful collection too!

If you'd like to contribute to this collection,
follow the guidelines below!

CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
***********************
1) Sounds MUST be in .WAV format. If the sound
was originally in another format, convert to
WAV using free audio software (we recommend
Audacity) before submitting. Please keep the
sample rates at or above 22,050 Hz, and if
you have to convert the sound, please keep
its original sample rate and sound channels
(mono or stereo). If the sound falls below
22,050 Hz but still sounds good, submit it
and we'll thoroughly review it.

2) Sounds MUST be featured in any of the
official Star Wars films. Prequel, Original
and Sequel trilogy sound effects are accepted.
Spinoff/TV series/unofficial content are not
accepted (i.e., Star Wars: Rebels, The Clone
Wars series, random public domain sounds,
etc.) If you know where the sound plays in
the original films, please let us know where
if you can. Clean film quotes are welcome.

3) Sounds MUST be free of background noise!
This is a biggie! We're looking for clean
samples, ones for fanmade projects and the
like. Background noise would hamper the
quality of the sound, making it impossible
to use.

4) Submit your sound effects to either of
these two YouTube channels:
A - iteachvader
B - Star Wars Video Game Sounds (SWVGS)
Please provide us with your username, as
your name will be added to the list of
contributors in this readme! PLEASE DO
NOT GIVE OUT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH
AS YOUR REAL NAME OR ADDRESS!!! THIS IS A
FREE SOUND COLLECTION, MEANING EVERYONE HAS
ACCESS TO IT!!! Let's try not to get us
sued here, kthnxbai.
