# Star Wars Soundboard for X-Wing
Table top game X-wing needs some proper Star Wars sound effect to triple the fun. Who am I not to try my hand at it? (Also a nice playground to teach myself some Javascript).

## Install
```
npm install
```

## Development
To start SCSS compilation and JS uglification:
```
gulp
```

To build to dest folder:

gulp build
```

### X-wing specific assets
I grabbed X-wing assets made by [geordanr](http://geordanr.github.io/xwing), especially the [webfont](https://github.com/geordanr/xwing-miniatures-font) created by [Hinny](https://github.com/Hinny) and [armoredgear7](https://github.com/armoredgear7) was especially useful.
